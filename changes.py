# Line 91 = () for end of function.
# Line 28 = missing '='.
# Line 13 = now it will stop printing once it hits 5, instead of an infinite loop. [WRONG]
# Line 16 (additional line made) = adds one to loading variable. once it hits 5, it will stop the loop.
# Line 33 =  only 4 options (starting from 0), therefore changing this to length of the actual list would fix any errors.
# Line 34 = prints divison as well.
# Line 44 + 45 (additional line made) =  if only the name list is updated, it causes the lists to be different lengths, causing an error when viewing as it relies on the lists being parallel (pulling data for 7th crew member: n[6] + r[6] + d[6] would only be possible if lists were updated correctly).
# Line 53 - 60 = creating if statement prevents crash if the name entered does not exist in the list.
