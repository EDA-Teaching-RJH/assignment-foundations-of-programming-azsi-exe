# Line 91 = () for end of function.
# Line 28 = missing '='.
# Line 13 = now it will stop printing once it hits 5, instead of an infinite loop. [WRONG]
# Line 16 (additional line made) = adds one to loading variable. once it hits 5, it will stop the loop.
# Line 33 =  only 4 options (starting from 0), therefore changing this to length of the actual list would fix any errors.
